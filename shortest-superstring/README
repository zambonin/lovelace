The shortest superstring problem belongs to the NP-hard class and is defined
as follows: given a set of strings S where no element is substring of another
element, find the shortest string that contains each string in S as substring.

A possible optimization is based on generating C(n, 2) combinations with a
faster algorithm, and dropping the vector holding the overlap values. Note
that the tests may not pass since the algorithm can find shorter superstrings
than the original code.
