Na√Øve matrix multiplication code used to demonstrate how compilers can
optimize loops depending on their passes. `icc` can invert the innermost
two loops to ascertain a better cache alignment.

Usage: ./mm <sq. matrix side>

A Python automated tuner can be executed to explore some common compiler flags
used to optimize the code.

Usage: python autotuner.py "cmd"

Code that multiplies sparse matrices is available in C++.

Usage: ./smm m_file_1 m_file_2
