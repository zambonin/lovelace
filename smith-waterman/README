The Smith-Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment. It compares
segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure.

Generate a pair of sequences and pass them as arguments to the algorithm, e.g.:

    $ ./generator 5000 $(RANDOM) > base1
    $ ./generator 5000 $(RANDOM) > base2
    $ ./sw base{1,2}
