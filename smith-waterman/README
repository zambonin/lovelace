The Smith-Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment. It compares
segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure.
A possible optimization is to implement a parallel version of this algorithm,
as seen in [1].

Generate a pair of sequences and pass them as arguments to the algorithm, e.g.:

    $ ./generator 5000 $RANDOM > base1
    $ ./generator 5000 $RANDOM > base2
    $ ./sw base{1,2}
