Example of how managing elements contiguously in memory can achieve an overall
better performance when traversing an array. In the case of C, arrays are
row-major ordered; hence, when forcing a column-aligned data read, cache
locality will suffer greatly. Based on @llpilla's implementation.

Usage: ./matrix_access
  -h	Show this message
  -a	Accesses the matrix by column
  -d	Prints debug information
  -c n	Number of columns for the matrix (default = 100)
  -r n	Number of rows for the matrix (default = 100)
