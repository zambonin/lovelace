The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a
weighted graph with no negative cycles. A single execution of the algorithm
will find the lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

The commands below may help in visualizing how much time executions take.

    $ sed -i '7,18d; 21,24d; 43,47d; 65,67d; 102,105d; /_time/d' fw.c
    $ TIMEFORMAT='%E'
    $ for i in {1..100} ; do (time ./fw graph) 2>&1 ; done | sort | uniq -c

To rollback the changes:

    $ unset TIMEFORMAT
    $ git checkout fw.c     # all other edits will be lost
