REQUIRES
- latexmk (w/pdflatex backend)
- g++ 4.8+ or equ. clang
- time (GNU/POSIX)

COMPILING

The program employs C++11 features.
The Makefile already provides the g++ compliante -std=c++11.
If your compiler uses another parameter to enable it, please change it accordingly.

- make all : builds binaries shsup and ingen, and problem description shortest_superstring.pdf
- make bin : builds binaries shsup and ingen
- make doc : builds problem description shortest_superstring.pdf
- make test : runs binary shsup over the example input file
- make clean : cleans all generated files

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
- shsup < xxx.txt
    Runs over input file xxx.txt.

Input and output's format is described at the shortest_superstring.pdf file, generated along with the binary.

INPUT GENERATOR

Builds an input file for shsup using all the permutations of a given string given as its own input.

- ingen < xxx.txt
    Runs over input file xxx.txt.

The input is a string with all characters used to build shsup's input.
The output is input text for shsup built by permuttating all letters on the given input string.

The eval input file, for instance, was generated using:
./ingen <<< "ABCDE"
