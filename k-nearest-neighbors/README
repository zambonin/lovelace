In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric
method used for classification and regression. It can be useful to assign
weight to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors
contribute more to the average than the more distant ones.

Usage:

    $ python
    >>> from knn import KNN
    >>> knn = KNN('tests/fisher_dataset.csv', 5) # example data and clusters
    >>> knn.classify('tests/fisher_testset.csv')
    ...
    >>> knn.write_csv(_, '/path/to/file.csv')
