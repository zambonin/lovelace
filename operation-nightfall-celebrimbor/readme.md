# Operation Nightfall

## Task

* Develop an auto-tuner

### Expected features

* Code should be able to try different compilation flags
* Code should be able to vary parameters (e.g., the value of 'STEP')
* Code must output the best set of compilation flags found or even the compiler call to be used

## Suggestions

* Start from autotuner-prototype.py
* *timeit* could be used to time executions
