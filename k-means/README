k-means clustering aims to partition `n` observations into `k` clusters in
which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. This
results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. Code based
on [1]. A possible optimization consists in using a k-d tree to represent
the centroids data.

Usage:

    $ python
    >>> from kmeans import KMeans
    >>> kmeans = KMeans(10, 2000) # number of clusters and points
    >>> kmeans.find_centers()
    >>> kmeans.plot_board()
