In graph theory, a connected component of an undirected graph is a subgraph
in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is
connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph. The list of components
can be found in linear time (in terms of the numbers of the vertices and
edges of the graph) using either breadth-first or depth-first search.

Generate a graph using the generator found inside Floyd-Warshall's folder,
and pass it to the executable.

    $ ./find_components <graph_file>
